Video Guide - [https://youtu.be/R24q0e2q9eY](https://youtu.be/R24q0e2q9eY)

Hey everyone, it’s Dan from Sidehustle Reliance. Today we’ll be exploring Phone Farming in 2022, and if it’s profitable. Firstly, you may be wondering what is phone farming, and in simple terms, it’s using existing phones to make Money through different applications and websites. This was really popular back in 2018, but people sadly overused the platform, and in doing so destroyed the whole community. Recently, me and my fellow creator, [LazyMoneyUK](https://www.youtube.com/c/LazyMoneyUK), have been exploring the idea of Phone farms returning!

The first main area was to explore the profitability, and in doing so it’s the perfect time to discuss my phone farm. In this guide, I’m going to run you through everything, the costs, the apps, the earnings, and the sweet sweet PROFIT! As will show you why it’s still worth doing in 2022 and NOT just in the US!

So I’ve currently got 4 phones, three Moto G5 and one Nokia 3.1. I run four phones because I believe anything more wouldn’t be as cost-efficient, as only certain apps are worth running. These phones are all running android and need to run android to be profitable. These phones cost me a total of £72.59 or $97.03

It costs me around £0.18 or $0.20 cents to run these phones a day, with them charging 50% of the time.

**Data Sharing Applications and using them in Phone farming**

To start with these phones are all running Honey and Peer2Profit, these are data-sharing applications, which allow you to sell unused data and bandwidth which can run in the background. The Honeygain platform can run on one device per IP, whilst Peer2profit can run on an unlimited amount devices, you can easily get started by signing up on their website by clicking the links in the description and downloading the APK from their sites. I currently make about £0.53 or $0.72 a day.

**Playtime Rewards for Phone Farming**

The next key app on these phones is an offerwall called Playtime rewards. Basically, Playtime Rewards are embedded into certain sites, and by playing games, you can easily gain income, but the best thing, you can just let the apps run and not have to play the games to earn easy passive income. As this is the case, I’ve linked up my phones to run four different offer walls, which all allow playtime rewards to run. I’m currently running Cointiply, Ysense, and Swagbucks Playtime Rewards.

I have chosen these platforms as Yense and Swagbucks pay in full pennies, instead of a percent of one (some sites which offer playtime rewards pay a fraction of a penny, which means it can take a long period of time to earn anything). I’ve also chosen Cointiply as I believe the platform is user-friendly and I’m trying to get more into crypto. You can sign up to these sites below and then download their apps from the google play store, and go there offer pages and you should be able to see playtime rewards there. Once it’s there choose a game, and start earning! Across these four phones, I make around £3.37 or $4.50.

**Cryptotab**

Following on from this I use Cryptotab. This is a browser that allows you to mine Satoshi (small amounts of bitcoin) on your phone. You can easily sign up on their site and download the Android app. Please note, that you will NOT be mining on the PC as this will use up further electric costs. I have left a sign-up link to get started. Once you’ve signed up, you need to download the Android app from the google play store, there is either a free version or a paid version available.

The Free version limits you to 300 hashes a second, whilst the paid version is 1500 hashes a second, the more hashes you have, the more money you will make.

The paid version also allows you to mine for longer (the free version is up to 2 hours, whilst the paid is 3 hours) Once you’re all set up on your Android device you can start to mine by completing a captcha, and then you’re off. I mine around £0.20 of BTC, or $0.28 a day.

**LootTV, HideoutTV and Mode Music**

The three next applications I believe are a vital part to the phone farming community. These three applications are LootTV, HideoutTV and Mode Music. All of which are semi passive. It also think these three applications are ideal for any newbie to phone farming as it gives you a guide and a lot of structure.

**Loot TV**

Loot TV is a great passive earning for phone farming. LootTV is a site which requires no babysitting and will watch videos for you and reward you for them. If you transfer the points to Freecash, you’ll earn a 1 to 1 ratio, so 1,000 points is a $1. I earn about 35 cents a day with this.

**Hideout TV**

Similarly to LootTV is [Hideout.TV](https://Hideout.TV). It’s always a good idea to run [Hideout.TV](https://Hideout.TV) on the phone farm device, as it’s very idle, but every 4 hours you get a captcha asking you to complete it to prove you are watching. This actually pays more than Loot TV if transferred to the get paid to site LootUp, as that site allows you to spin a wheel for the chance to win a 50% bonus on your earnings on the site, I have made about $0.50 a day from this site

**Mode Music (Current)**

Next, I’d suggest running Current Music (now known as Mode). This is a music listening site where you can earn cash by letting music run passively. Every so often you will have to watch an ad, but it’s only every 3 or 4 hours, and you will gain some lost points (up to 30) as well as you’d get points for watching the ads. Another great thing about this application is that you can get cash by charging your device. If you’re cashing out to the $20 Paypal option. Normally 20 points are 1 cent. I make about $0.30 with this application

**Ember Fund**

Speaking of cloud mining, the next app you should use is called Ember Fund (EF). EF is like a Cryptotab, but more reliable, as you log in every 24 hours and you’ll mine 2.5 satoshis per hour. That means you’ll earn a total of 60 satoshis a day on EF, just sign up and begin mining. You can be estimated to easily earn 4 cents a day, with one check-in!

**Cashpiggy**

I also use the daily check in-app Cashpiggy, to net $0.04 or £0.03 across the four devices. This is such an easy task to do. You just download the app and then click “daily 10 points” to gain your daily bonus! You can only do this once every 24 hours. This means I’m making around $0.16 or £0.12 a day from Cashpiggy!

**S’mores, MyRobinhood and 101Sweets on Phone Farming**

Finally, I run Smores and My Robinhood. These apps allow you “swipe” to unlock your device and you get $0.10 every time you do it. You can do this daily on your devices, and as both S’more and MyRobinhood can run alongside each other, you can double your potential earnings, but please note, you can only do this activity once per application per device. I’m making $1.20 there, or £0.90. You can get started by downloading the apps from the google play store, the links are below!

**Conclusion to Phone Farming**

Finally, my running costs are £0.18 or $0.20, and my revenue is $7.91, which means my profit is $7.71 per day! Not bad for 4 phones which cost me £72. So that technically means I’ll pay these phones off in 11 days, which is a crazy ROI.

But why won’t I get more phones…. The simple answer is, I believe it’s not worth it, the profit will slowly start to curve off. I’m holding off until I find another app that pays in full pennies, I’m not going to invest in any more phones. Check out my iOS Phone farming guide here!
